# UX Barf
A language experiment that creates random UX statements which are complete barf, but to some people might sound like sense.

Check out [how this thing runs](http://flexewebs.com/labs/uxbarf).

It's tricky to formulate proper English sentences as there are so many weird and wonderful quasi-rules in the way the language works.

#Example output 

Some of the sentences I've managed to generate with this include: 

* 'The Information Architecture believes past the stakeholder.'
* 'A design wills up a wireframe.'
* 'The facts develop above the visuals.'
* 'The user journey thinks past the experience.'
* 'An app iterates above a social media.'
* 'The brand likes near the visuals.'
* 'The solution wills up the user journey.'
* 'A sketch thinks beneath a wireframe.'
* 'A channel discusses in a design.'
* 'The personas develop in a brand.'
* 'The channel scraps up the research.'
* 'A technology develops like the personas.'
