# UX Barf - Barfing up UX gumpf 

##What is this? 

A language experiment that creates random UX statements which are complete barf, but to some people might sound like sense.

##The idea 

I'm playing around with language. Trying to create a word 'wisdom' art on the subject of UX, but also other subject that can be feed into the data set.
There's something funny and verging on inspirational about computer generated sentences about UX.

##Example output

##Bugs and challenges 

* It's tricky to formulate proper English sentences as there are so many weird and wonderful quasi-rules in the way the language works.
* I'm trying to write something smarter here 
* English language structure is really tricky to deal with
* Sentences are still somewhat buggy and don't make as much sense as they could 
* I want to turn this into a more artistic output, both in terms of look and feel (of the content) 
* Needs to be AJAX driven, instead of a PHP refresh
* Nicer typography
